<p>Hi! I'm Jessica. I am a major food enthusiast, always taking photos of everything I eat and drink, so I figured it would only be fitting to build a little foodie blog for myself! I grew up without much chance to travel around, so I looked to food to fill that missing space. Through this, I believe I found what makes me truly happy. Since my early years, I have always loved eating different foods, no matter what type or culture, and in doing so, I feel as though I have experienced other parts of the world without actually going anywhere too far away from home. Some of my most cherished memories are those spent with family and good friends around great food and wine. My interest in fine dining, especially in the realm of molecular gastronomy, has greatly increased over the past year, but I still have a lot of fun being at home in my kitchen. Cooking, eating and exploring are all hobbies of mine.</p>

<p>One of my favorite past times is food scooting! Food scooting is all about spending a few hours or even a whole day getting lost in food adventures &ndash; picking a city and "scooting" to as many different restaurants and bars in that allotted time and trying small portions of what each place is known for. I try to get as much variety as possible, fitting in not only high end tastings, but great street food as well. </p>

<p>Top on my bucket list is to be able to actually travel throughout the country as well as around the world, and to really be able to experience food, wine and culture at their fullest. For now, I will keep on searching through SoCal to find new and exciting foodie adventures. Thanks for reading!</p>
