<p>Back in January, my dad coerced me into doing an overnight shift at a Disney 10k race passing out waters and supplies. I think I complained non-stop, but the light at the end of the tunnel was a free Disneyland parkhopper ticket! My annual pass had expired so I was pretty happy about the free ticket. My uncle and cousin had also participated in this event, so they along with my dad and I went for some food and rides.

I had had so many different foods from Disneyland in the past, but one restaurant, called <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/dining/disneyland/cafe-orleans/" target="_blank">Cafe Orleans</a>, always seemed so out of reach for me. It was impossible to ever get reservations, and after my lunch there, I realize why. They are most famous for their Monte Cristo sandwich, which is a ham and cheese sandwich dipped in batter, deep fried and covered in powdered sugar. I finally had the chance to try this, after something like two years of bad luck. It was really light, surprisingly. I definitely recommend! 

We also shared the braised beef crepes, served up with smashed peas and stewed carrots. I love anything and everything to do with braised beef, so if braised beef is ever on a menu, I will order it.


I don't care much for dessert, but Mickey beignets are always cute and fun. That ended up in a powdered sugar war between my little cousin and me!
