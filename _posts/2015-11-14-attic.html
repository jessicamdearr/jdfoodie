<p>My girlfriends and I got together for dinner and drinks at a cozy restaurant called <a href="http://www.theatticonbroadway.com/" target="_blank">The Attic</a> in Long Beach this Saturday. The food was so innovative and comforting, and the atmosphere was casual and homey.</p>

<p>This place packs really stiff drinks. I ordered a Blackberry Manhattan and it was one of the strongest Manhattans I have ever had. It was perfect for a chilly night out on the patio.</p>

<p>We ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeño and "Mac n' Cheetos" for starters. The jalapeño was extremely spicy but offset by the rich bacon wrapper. The Mac n' Cheetos was possibly the highlight of the night for me. It was so creamy with an added spice and crunch from the Cheetos topping.</p>

<p>For the main course, my friend and I decided to split one of the specials - the New York Strip. It was glazed in a smokey bourbon sauce and it was cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed my night out with the girls at this unique and laid-back restaurant.</p>
