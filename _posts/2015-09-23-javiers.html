<p>A few years ago, one of my good girlfriends took me out for some Mexican food at <a href="http://www.javiers-cantina.com/#!/page_HOME" target="_blank">Javier's</a>, and I have been hooked ever since. It could get a little expensive but it is definitely worth it. I love the flavors they put into their dishes, especially into their ceviches. Since my friend was leaving for Canada the next day, I found it the perfect excuse to head over for some Mexican food and cocktails.</p>

<p>I always love to go for as much variety as possible, so instead of getting a plate with two of the same flavor of item, I like to go for duos or trios. This time, I went for the trio of enchiladas, which included Dungeness crab, lobster and shrimp - really really great stuff. They make cheese work with seafood so flawlessly!!</p>

<p>My FAVORITE flavor ever is probably sour, and that is why I love Javier's ceviches. I always used to get the pulpo (octopus) version, but lately I have been asking for a mix between the fish and shrimp. It is just soooooo sour and amazing, with really bright and bold flavors. I could definitely go for some of this at any time.</p>

<p>Another favorite of mine is jalapeño margaritas, but only if they are extremely spicy. I am usually disappointed by jalapeño margaritas from restaurants because they are never spicy enough. This time, however, I emphasized my want for extra jalapeños, and they ended up putting ground up habanero peppers in it. The waiter even warned me that it would be too much. I got a disclaimer! I loved it though. It was exactly what I had in mind when I asked for extra spicy. All in all a great meal, as usual!</p>
