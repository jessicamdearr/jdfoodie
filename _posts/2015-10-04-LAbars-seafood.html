<p>This weekend, I was feeling in need of a mini escape. Los Angeles is my perfect getaway place. I went up to Hollywood to stay with some friends and run around town for a night. My friends are locals up there so they know of all the fun yet not overly crowded places to go to on a Saturday night. We hit up both the <a href="http://www.bigfootlodge.com/" target="_blank">Big Foot Lodge</a> and the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-griffin-los-angeles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Griffin</a>, both just a block away from each other. They were pretty unique bars, but both really dark inside.</p>

<p>The Big Foot Lodge was really homey, with a log cabin feel to it. It really did feel like a lodge in the forest. My friends recommended a drink called the Toasted Marshmallow, which was a creamy cocktail topped with a marshmallow that the bartender set on fire.</p>

<p>Before I drove up to LA, my friend kept raving about the Griffin being one of his favorite bars, and now I understand why. It felt like Hogwart's on the inside, with lots of dark wood, benches and fireplaces. It was more or less a pub, with casual bar appetizers. We opted for their tater tots. It was nice to kick back with drinks and pub food and enjoy the atmosphere. I always love the time I spend with my LA buddies.</p>

<p>I headed back to OC for a light dinner with my parents. We decided to try out the new <a href="http://www.tapsfishhouse.com/" target="_blank">TAPS Fish House &amp; Brewery</a> restaurant at the Irvine Market Place, and it was completely different from the one in Brea. The interior was very modern with clean lines and sleek furniture and wall decorations. The best part of the restaurant is their daily selection of fresh oysters. They restock their oysters every day, so the selection is always freshly caught and varied.</p>

<p>My mom ordered the crème brûlée to share for dessert, and the waiter torched it tableside for us.</p>
