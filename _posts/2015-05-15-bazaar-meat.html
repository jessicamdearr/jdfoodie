<p>José Andrés is my very favorite chef! I have been to his restaurant in LA a few times, but I never experienced anything quite like the <a href="http://sbe.com/restaurants/locations/bazaar-meat-las-vegas/" target="_blank">Bazaar Meat</a> in Las Vegas. It is such a beautiful restaurant, and everything is whimsical and elegant at the same time. I wish I had more pictures of the actual restaurant interior to show, but I will have to make up for that next time.</p>

<p>What I love most about José Andrés is his creativity and use of ingredients and colors in his dishes. Everything is so vibrant and inviting, and it is clear that so much thought and care has gone into each plate. He is able to turn already decadent items like abalone even greater, and moreso, he can put his own spin on pig ears and sloppy joes and somehow come through with a 5 star meal. Being in any José Andrés restaurant is such a great experience, and he is so inspirational to me.</p>

<p>That sloppy joe is a variation of his Philly cheesesteak sandwich, which has the same look and feel, but instead is filled with molten cheese and topped with paper thin slices of Wagyu beef carpaccio. I will have to catch a picture of that the next time I am at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills. </p>

<p>The blood sausage was one of the highlights of the night. I had never had that, or even really heard of it before. Each blood sausage slice was topped with uni, which is one of my favorite foods ever. Both items went together so well and it will definitely be something I would go back for.</p>

<p>I try to order lightly when I visit expensive restaurants such as this one. I want to go for the most well-known items and get as much variety as I can. Since I was at the Bazaar Meat, I felt it was only fitting to try a piece of meat! I went for the cheapest thing, which happened to be the Wagyu skirt steak ($35). IT WAS INSANE. It was a skirt steak, and somehow it was so much better than all the filets and ribeyes I had ever had. I ordered it rare-plus (higher than rare and below medium rare) and there were absolutely no words to describe how great it was.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-pull-4"><p>To finish off, I opted for a small dessert. Most of José Andrés' desserts are tiny, which is pretty cool to me. I am not really a dessert person, but the presentation of 20 or so tiny candies and tarts is hard to deny. This tart was raspberry filled and topped with edible gold flakes. With that, I completed another great José Andrés meal and I look forward to more inspirational creations!</p></div>
