excerpt: I was able to visit Jose Andres' Bazaar Meat in the SLS hotel in Las Vegas. I was so surprised to find an almost completely different menu than that of the Bazaar in Beverly Hills.

<p>Jose Andres is my favorite chef of all times! I have been to his restaurant in LA a few times, but I never experienced anything quite like the Bazaar Meat in Las Vegas. It is such a beautiful restaurant, and everything is literally perfect! I wish I had more pictures of the actual restaurant interior to show, but I will have to make up for that next time.</p>

<p>What I love most about Jose Andres is his creativity and use of ingredients and colors in his dishes. Everything is so vibrant and inviting, and it is clear that so much thought and care has gone into each plate. He is able to turn already decadent items like abalone even greater, and moreso, he can put his own spin on pig ears and sloppy joes and somehow come through with a 5 star meal. Being in any Jose Andres restaurant is such a great experience, and he is so inspirational to me.</p>

<p>That sloppy joe is a variation of his philly cheese steak sandwich, which has the same look and feel, but instead is filled with molten cheese and topped with paper thin slices of Wagyu beef carpaccio. I will have to catch a picture of that the next time I am at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills. </p>

<p>The blood sausage was one of the highlights of the night. I had never had that, or even really heard of it before. Each blood sausage slice was topped with uni, which is one of my favorite foods ever. Both items went together so well and it will definitely be something I would go back for.</p>

<div class="col-sm-8"><p>To be honest, I try to order lightly when I visit expensive restaurants such as this one. I want to go for the most well-known items and get as much variety as I can. Since I was at the Bazaar Meat, I felt it was only fitting to try a piece of meat! I went for the cheapest thing, which happened to be the Wagyu skirt steak ($35). IT WAS INSANE. It was a skirt steak, and how was it so much better than all the filets and ribeyes I had ever had? I ordered it rare-plus (higher than rare and below medium rare) and there were absolutely no words to describe how great it was. The picture does not do it justice at all.</p>

<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-pull-4"><p>To finish off, I opted for a small dessert. Most of Jose Andres' desserts are tiny, which is pretty cool to me. I am not really a dessert person, but the presentation of 20 or so tiny candies and tarts is hard to deny. This tart was raspberry filled and topped with gold. Too cute too cute!! With that, I completed another great meal and I look forward to more inspirational creations!</p></div>
