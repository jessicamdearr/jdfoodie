<p>I picked up my friends from LAX and thought it would be a good idea to have a late dinner in LA after a long plane flight. One of my favorite spots up there is Tom Bergin's Public House. I used to go there all the time with my best friend back in the day, so I thought it would be fun to pay it a visit. They make a stiff drink and large portions of Irish comfort food &ndash; great for sharing.</p>

<p>Whenever I visit Tom Bergin's, I never skip out on the brussel sprouts and fried pickle chips.</p>
