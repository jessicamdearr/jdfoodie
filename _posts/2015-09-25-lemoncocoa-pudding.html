<p>I have never been the biggest fan of sweets, but lately, I have been trying to broaden my horizons &ndash; attempting to transform things that I don't necessarily like into things that I do! I have been experimenting with simple pudding recipes and have been finding them to be way too sweet. I decided to try adding in some citrus liqueur for a brighter note that I find missing in boring everyday puddings and I think this came out pretty well!</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<blockquote><ul class="ingredient-list">
<li>3 egg yolks</li>
<li>2 cups milk</li>
<li>1/4 cups butter</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 lemon zested</li>
<li>2 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
<li>4 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 tablespoon Grand Marnier (or orange liqueur)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In a medium saucepan, whisk 1 1/2 milk with butter, sugar and cocoa powder and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Combine leftover milk, egg yolks, salt, cornstarch and vanilla extract in a bowl, and slowly pour in some of the heated mixture while whisking. Combine both mixtures and set on low heat. Add in the lemon juice, lemon zest and Grand Marnier and whisk until thick. Pour into 4 ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Let pudding cups set in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Serve chilled topped with whipped cream. Enjoy!</p>
