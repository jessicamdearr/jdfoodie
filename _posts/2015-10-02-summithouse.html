<p>For my 25th birthday, my good friend, Kyle, took me out to an amazing restaurant called Summit House on a hill in Fullerton. It was absolutely beautiful and the view was breathtaking. We got dressed up all fancy and met there for a night of what the restaurant was most famous for: prime rib. I starved myself all day to be hungry for this place!</p>

<p>I had never heard of this restaurant before, but my friend insisted that it was the best prime rib restaurant he had ever been to. We sat windowside looking over the view of the city, and ordered a glass of red wine. The wine pours were so generous, they might as well have been doubled.</p>

<p>The prime rib was just as amazing as I expected. I ordered the Summit House cut rare plus, which is just a little over rare. The waiter poured au jus over the meat and the Yorkshire pudding, and everything was perfect. The restaurant is pretty famous for their creamed corn, which was better than any I had ever had before. The crazy thing is that they share their recipe for it on their website.</p>

<p>What I loved about this restaurant was the classy decor and fancy attire paired with very homey, English-style comfort food. It was so beautiful the great food really made for an amazing evening.</p>
