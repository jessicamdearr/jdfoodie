<p>Quiches are such a great way to clear out leftover eggs and vegetables from your refrigerator. I have found them to be really easy and fun to make too! I will usually try to pack as many ingredients as I can to get the most flavor out of the finished quiche. I prefer to leave out the pie crust when making quiches, so this recipe will not include one. The process is pretty much the same with or without a pie crust.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<blockquote><ul class="ingredient-list">
<li>6 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup salad greens chopped</li>
<li>1/2 tomato diced</li>
<li>1/2 cup pancetta diced</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
<li>1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese grated</li>
<li>1/2 shallot minced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li> 1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Faranheit. In a small saucepan on medium high, heat the pancetta until browned, then add in the shallots and garlic and adjust to medium low heat until crispy. Transfer to a bowl lined with a paper towel and put to the side. In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, salad greens, tomato, cheddar, parsley, salt, pepper. Fold in the pancetta until evenly distributed. Lightly grease a 9&ndash;inch baking dish and pour in the egg mixture. Bake for 30 minutes, take out and sprinkle with parmesan, and put back in for 10 more minutes. Quiche is great served either hot or room temperature.</p>
