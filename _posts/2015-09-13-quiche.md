<p><img class="pull-left" src="/images/posts/2015-09-13-quiche/rawquiche.jpg"/>Quiches are such a great way to clear out leftover eggs and vegetables from your refrigerator. I have found them to be really easy and fun to make too! I will usually try to pack as many ingredients as I can to get the most flavor out of the finished quiche.</p>

I prefer to leave out the pie crust when making quiches, so this recipe will not include one. The process is pretty much the same with or without a pie crust. 

Ingredients: 
  6 eggs
