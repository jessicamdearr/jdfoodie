<p>My friend and I took a break from walking around the mall to stop for a late lunch at <a href="http://www.holsteinsburgers.com/" target="_blank">Holstein's</a> in Costa Mesa. All of the food was amazing and made for a great break from shopping on a weekend. Holstein's is located in Bloomingdale's at South Coast Plaza, so it was also a very convenient place to hang out.</p>

<p>Instead of bread service, this restaurant serves flavored popcorn before the main meal. We got pizza flavored popcorn, and it was really awesome.</p>

<p>We started off with a Bloody Mary. They were no specialty cocktails on the menu, but we decided to get some anyway.</p>

<p>My friend and I have been into Macaroni and Cheese dishes lately, so when we saw the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese on the menu, we could not resist. There were large chunks of lobster throughout the whole dish, and it was really well balanced with the richness of the cheese.</p>

<p>For the main course, my friend and I split a burger. There were so many specialty burgers on the menu, but we ended up going for the Gold Standard, which was a burger made with a dry-aged patty and bacon. It was cooked perfectly and really satisfying for a relaxing late lunch.</p>
