<p>This weekend was the perfect excuse for a food scoot! Food and drinks are my favorite way to have a good time. I started off at Wasa, a great sushi restaurant at the Spectrum, and tried some of their specialty tasters, which included nigiri style sushi pieces with assorted fish and garnishes. Front and center was their seared salmon topped with colored daikon and green onions.</p>

<p>What I love most about Jose Andres is his creativity and use of ingredients and colors in his dishes. Everything is so vibrant and inviting, and it is clear that so much thought and care has gone into each plate. He is able to turn already decadent items like abalone even greater, and moreso, he can put his own spin on pig ears and sloppy joes and somehow come through with a 5 star meal. Being in any Jose Andres restaurant is such a great experience, and he is so inspirational to me.</p>

<p>That sloppy joe is a variation of his philly cheese steak sandwich, which has the same look and feel, but instead is filled with molten cheese and topped with paper thin slices of Wagyu beef carpaccio. I will have to catch a picture of that the next time I am at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills. </p>


To be honest, I try to order lightly when I visit expensive restaurants such as this one. I want to go for the most well-known items and get as much variety as I can. Since I was at the Bazaar Meat, I felt it was only fitting to try a piece of meat! I went for the cheapest thing, which happened to be the Wagyu skirt steak ($35). IT WAS INSANE. It was a skirt steak, and how was it so much better than all the filets and ribeyes I had ever had? I ordered it rare-plus (higher than rare and below medium rare) and there were absolutely no words to describe how great it was. The picture does not do it justice at all.</p>

To finish off, I opted for a small dessert. Most of Jose Andres' desserts are tiny, which is pretty cool to me. I am not really a dessert person, but the presentation of 20 or so tiny candies and tarts is hard to deny. This tart was raspberry filled and topped with gold. Too cute too cute!! With that, I completed another great meal and I look forward to more inspirational creations!</p>
