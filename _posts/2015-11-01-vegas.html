<p>I got the opportunity to go on a little overnight mini-vacation to Las Vegas! I was so excited to visit as many places as possible to eat all kinds of food. Sadly, I only had around 24 hours, but I made it worth it.</p>

<p>My friend and I made it to Las Vegas around 11:00 a.m. and the first place we visited was a restaurant called <a href="http://www.hubertkeller.com/restaurants/fleur-by-hubert-keller.html" target="_blank">Fleur by Hubert Keller</a> for some brunch and their lovely Bloody Mary bar! The Bloody Mary bar was so much fun. We were able to build our own cocktails out of a huge variety of ingredients &ndash; my friend ordered her Bloody Mary to be made with bacon infused vodka! I went the spicy route with jalapeño infused vodka. Our favorite part of the entire drink was the addition of shrimp! The two of us have a major shrimp obsession so we were very happy.</p>

<p>After brunch, my friend and I took a taxi up towards the center of the strip and walked around. I really like to pick up Jello shots from <a href="http://www.fat-tuesday.com/site.php?pageID=299&bcat=mgm-grand-hotel" target="_blank">Fat Tuesday</a> with added whipped cream.</p>

<p>The dinner was definitely the highlight of the trip. We met up with some friends at <a href="http://www.mandalaybay.com/dining/stripsteak/?kbid=2584521&cvosrc=ppc.google.stripsteak&cvo_crid=69541266612&Matchtype=p&ecid=sem_%25epid%21" target="_blank">Stripsteak</a> at the Mandalay Bay resort for a really fun night! The waiter gave us a complimentary trio of duck fat fries, all with different dipping sauces. </p>

<p>For the main course, my friend and I split the 10 ounce filet mignon rare-plus, and we both absolutely loved it. It was packed with flavor and perfectly cooked and red throughout. I love eating steak with this girl because we both prefer ours cooked very minimally.</p>

<p>Another friend in our dinner group ordered the ahi tuna, which was surprisingly tasty. It was perfectly seasoned, and it was delicate and hearty at the same time. He was so happy with his dish! We ordered the macaroni and cheese and bone marrow for the table to share. The entire experience was so much fun with truly exciting food. The restaurant was really beautiful and such a great place to hang out with an amazing group of friends!</p>

<p>My friend and I had time for one last stop before having to get back on the road. We originally wanted to try out Burger Bar, an upscale burger restaurant by Hubert Keller, but we instead opted for the Irish pub next door called <a href="http://www.rira.com/" target="_blank">Rí Rá</a>. We ordered their wild wings, and they were so satisfyingly spicy and comforting paired with their blue cheese dipping sauce. </p>

<p>We had a really great time in Las Vegas and we look forward to doing another little trip again soon. We will try to cram even more food in next time!</p>
