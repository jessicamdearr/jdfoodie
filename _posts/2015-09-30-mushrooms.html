<p>My roommate/coworker, Shibani, and I recently moved to a new apartment together, and we have so much to celebrate! Shibani recently got an offer for a new position at another company, and though I am sad about it because we won't work together anymore, I am so excited for her to take off in her career. Sometimes being in the same place for too long has a negative affect, so it will be good to start fresh. I also turn 25 this week, so as a birthday resolution, I will experience more things and definitely eat more food.</p>

<p>Shibani and I celebrated by having a little cooking night, doing it up vegetarian-style. Pinterest has a lot of cute food pictures that make you want to try out new recipes and put your own spin on them. We found a mushroom and egg recipe that looked pretty neat, so we gave it a shot. </p>
