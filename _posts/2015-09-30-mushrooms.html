<p>My roommate/coworker, Shibani, and I recently moved to a new apartment together, and we have so much to celebrate! Shibani recently got an offer for a position at another company, and though I am sad about it because we won't work together anymore, I am so excited for her to take off in her new career. Sometimes being in the same place for too long has a negative affect, so it will be good to start fresh. I am so proud of her and I wish her all the best! I also turn 25 this week, so as a birthday resolution, I will have more fun, experience more things and definitely eat more food.</p>

<p>Shibani and I celebrated by having a little roomie cooking night, doing it up vegetarian-style. Pinterest has a lot of cute food pictures that make you want to try out new recipes and put your own spin on them. We found a mushroom and egg recipe that looked pretty neat, so we gave it a shot with our own little spin on it.</p>

<p>We both really liked cooking up these mushrooms. It was pretty easy and didn't take a lot of time, and it tasted great too.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<blockquote><ul class="ingredient-list">
<li>4 large portobello mushrooms</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon shallot minced</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>1/4 cup favorite arrabiata sauce</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1/4 cup Parmesan cheese grated</li>
<li>parsley to garnish</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Turn broiler on high heat. Wipe mushrooms clean with a paper towel, and place on foil lined baking sheet. Place in the broiler for 5 minutes, then flip over for 5 more minutes. Turn the oven to bake at 400F. Spoon a bit of the arrabiata sauce into each mushroom, and sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Crack an egg into each mushroom, and sprinkle with shallots and garlic. Put back in oven for 15 minutes or until eggs whites are completely cooked and firm. Top with Parmesan cheese and parsley. This goes really well with saut√©ed vegetables. </p>
