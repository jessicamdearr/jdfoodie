<p>FINALLY!! I was so happy to get another opportunity to visit my favorite restaurant in the entire universe &ndash; the <a href="http://sbe.com/restaurants/brands/thebazaar/" target="_blank">Bazaar by José Andrés</a>! I love any chance to visit this spectacular restaurant, even if it is just for a light dinner. It felt like I hadn't been there in ages, and so it was refreshing to get to eat there again.</p>

<p>What I love about the Bazaar is the tapas-style ordering &ndash; you can get so many different small dishes and get to try a bigger variety of items. I tried a cone that was José Andrés' take on bagel and lox. I love how the salmon roe represents the lox on a bagel. I decided to revisit some old favorites with the other two dishes. The "Organized Caesar Salad" is wrapped up and topped with quail egg yolks and puffed croutons, and it all falls apart into an actual mouthful of salad when you bite into it. The jar contains a mixture of egg and potatoes, and the crunch and salt flakes brings the whole dish together really nicely.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite dish at the Bazaar is the Philly cheesesteak. I never visit this restaurant without ordering this amazing sandwich. Nothing could be better than a puffed roll filled with molten cheese topped with Wagyu carpaccio slices.</p>

<p>The Bazaar has a way of making all problems and stresses disappear. I had a truly amazing time and look forward to another visit to the best restaurant in the world!</p>
