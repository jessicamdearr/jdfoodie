<p>I absolutely LOVE chicken wings, and am always trying to find new ways to improve my recipe. I used to be hooked on places like Buffalo Wild Wings, but making chicken wings on your own can be just as satisfying. I find that homemade wings can be even better than wings from a restaurant &ndash; AND way cheaper!</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<blockquote><ul class="ingredient-list">
<li>18 frozen chicken wings</li>
<li>3 cups Canola or Vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
<li>2 ounces hot sauce (Tabasco or Tapatio)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Preheat oil to 400 degrees Farenheit using a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, combine salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder in a bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the butter and mix in the hot sauce until combined. Set aside. Season chicken wings on both sides with the seasoning mixture. Drop chicken wings in the preheated oil and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and repeat for 5 minutes, and repeat until total cooking time equals 20 minutes. Remove from oil and pour over hot sauce mixture until throroughly coated. Serve hot with celery sticks and blue cheese sauce or ranch!</p>
