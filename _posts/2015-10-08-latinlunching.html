<p>I picked up some friends from LAX and thought it would be a good idea to have a late dinner in LA after a long plane flight. One of my favorite spots up there is <a href="http://www.tombergins.com/" target="_blank">Tom Bergin's Public House</a>. I used to go there all the time with my best friend back in the day when she lived in the area, so I thought it would be fun to pay it a visit. They make a stiff drink and large portions of Irish comfort food &ndash; great for sharing.</p>

<p>Whenever I visit Tom Bergin's, I never skip out on the brussel sprouts and fried pickle chips. They make their own pickles in house and use the brine as backs or chasers for their whiskey shots &ndash; whiskles!</p>
