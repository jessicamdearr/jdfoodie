<p>I have always wondered about the best way to make a great crust on a steak, and as of recently, I think I have found a pretty good way to achieve that. In my opinion, a good crust on a steak is the best part. I like to pick steaks that are almost 3 inches tall, so that it is easier to cook them about rare plus and get a good, even crust on them.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<blockquote><ul class="ingredient-list">
<li>2 filet mignon steaks</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Weber steak seasoning</li>
<li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Pat the steaks dry on both sides with a paper towel. Cover steaks generously in cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and steak seasoning. Store in freezer for about 20-30 minutes. Heat olive oil and butter in an iron saucepan on high heat. Get the oil and butter mixture really hot &ndash; about 350F. Take the steaks out of the freezer and place on the hot pan. Cook on both sides for about 2 minutes (for rare plus). Remove from heat, cover with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Enjoy with a side vegetable or mashed potatoes! </p>
